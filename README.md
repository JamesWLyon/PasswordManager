# PasswordManager
This is a simple password manager I made to keep track of all your passwords.

Just over over the "Create Password" button, it will have a little drop down menu you can fill out. Then click the "Add Password" button to add the password and its info.

* Just for clarification, the location input in the drop down, is the location for the username and password. Like if you were keeping a password for a gmail account the location could be "Gmail", if you were keeping a password for a github account the location could be "GitHub".

* Also the random button generates a random password of whatever lengtb you have set.
